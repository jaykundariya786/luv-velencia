### HOW TO MEASURE

To select the correct shoe size, follow these steps to measure your feet and refer to the foot length column in the sizing guide:

1. Wear the socks or tights you typically wear with this type of shoe.
2. Stand straight on a flat surface with your heel against a wall. If needed, have someone assist you with the measurements.
3. Measure from the base of your heel, keeping it pressed against the wall, to the tip of your longest toe.
4. Measure both feet and use the length of your longest foot as your reference in the sizing guide.

Select the size of the item to see the expected delivery date.
